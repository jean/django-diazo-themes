	    The IW:LEARN Geonode aims to provide a customizable mapping of the GEF International Waters
	    (IW) portfolio and provide a visualization of studies, reports and intervention results on the various
	    transboundary water basins pulled together with the help of the GEF IW projects, partner organizations
	    and authoritative sources and other contributors.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The IW:LEARN Geonode aims to provide a central service for sharing and discovering geodata. The
	    platform lets users upload, manage, and browse and visualize data, and export public data in reusable
	    formats.
	    </p>
	    <p>GeoNode is an open source platform for sharing geospatial data and maps that enables GEF IW projects and partner organizations to host and share geodata and maps online through the IW:LEARN server, and generate custom maps for embedding in their own website.</p>
